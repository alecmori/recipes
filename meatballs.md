# Meatballs

Generally goes good with a tomato sauce that is very basil heavy.

## Makes

~16 inch diameter meatballs

## Ingredients

- 1 lb ground turkey
- 0.5 cups panko bread crumbs
- 0.5 cups parmesian cheese
- 2 tablespoons of parsley
- 2 teaspoons onion powder
- 4 cloves of Garlic
- 0.5 (plus) cups olive oil
- Copious amounts of salt, pepper

## Utilities

- Medium sized bowl
- Frying pan

## Recipe

1. Mince garlic.
2. Mix all ingredients into a bowl until homogenized. Use lots of salt, pepper.
3. Heat pan to low-medium heat. Add a little bit of oil.
4. Make meatballs about 1 inch diameter thick. Found that's the best diameter to cook thoroughly without roasting outermost layer. Fry as many as can comfortably fit in a pan.
    - To taste test, throw a small bit of the homogenized meat mixture in. Repeat until seasoned well.
    - Meat pyramids (as opposed to ball) seem to be the best compromise between cooking outside evenly and still having a ball-like shape.
