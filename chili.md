Too lazy to write down now, but basically this except

1. Season meat heavily beforehand,with different flavoring (oregeno, chili
   powder, berbere for me).
2. 1.5x spices
3. Jalapeno pepper with seeds, not poblano chili
4. 2x garlic
5. 1 more can of beans, 1 red or green pepper.
6. Tomato cans should be seasoned (garlic or chili pepper flavors work well).
7. When mixing in slow cooker, all ingredients except tomatoes should be added
   and mixed. Then add tomatoes to top. Close without stirring. Every two
   hours, open and stir.
