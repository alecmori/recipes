## Makes

## Ingredients

- 16 oz elbow macaroni
- 8 oz sharp cheddar cheese
- 8 oz colby jack cheese
- 8 oz part-skim mozzarella cheese
- 8 oz American cheese
- 4 oz cream cheese
- 1 cup half and half
- 1 cup heavy cream
- black pepper to taste
- 0.5 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 0.25 teaspoons mustard powder
- 2 eggs
- 4.5 tablespoons Butter
- 1.5 cups of Panko bread crumbs

### Optional

- 8 oz of Gouda
- 8 oz of Gruyere
- 1.5x of each spice, if served with less flavored dishes

## Utilities

- Cheese grater
- 9 x 13 (glass) baking pan
- Pot
- Sieve
- Large mixing bowl

## Recipe

1. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Shred all cheese (except cream cheese). Leave half of the cheddar, gruyere
   and colby jack to the side - put rest into mixing bowl.
   - If cheese type is not particularly shred-able, just tear and put in bowl.
     It will be mixed later.
3. Boil macaroni to al dente texture. Drain quickly.
4. Pour half and half, heavy cream, and cream cheese into shredded cheese. Mix
   fairly well.
   - I don't strive to homogeneity here, as I enjoy having globs of cheese
     within the macaroni and cheese.
5. Mix spices into cheese mixture. Then, mix in two eggs and macaroni.
   - If you want to taste seasoning, do it before mixing in egg.
6. Rub down the 9 x 13 pan with butter.
7. Melt butter in pot you used earlier, then let the panko bread crumbs soak up
   the butter mixture.
8. Pour macaroni mixture into 9 x 13 pan. Top with remaining cheese and panko
   bread crumbs.
9. Bake for 30 minutes.
