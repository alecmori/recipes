## Recipe

### Rice
1. Put **three cups** of water with **1 cup** of rice in the rice cooker. Cook
   for forty minutes.
   - Use put a little extra water in between rice container and cooking
     aparatus to heat more easily.

### Curry (15 minutes after rice starts)

1. Fry onions in 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil, salt, and pepper on medium heat for two
   minutes until transparent.
2. Add carrots and potatos, stir for three minutes.
3. Add diced garlic, stir for one minute.
4. Add five cups of water, cover pot for fifteen minutes.
5. Uncover pot, put in golden curry, turn off heat, and stir.

### Katsu (20 minutes after rice starts cooking)
1. Heat 1/4 inch of vegetable oil in pot and heat on medium-hot. 
   - You can test if it's ready by throwing in bread crumbs - if it sizzles,
     it's ready.
2. Hammer chicken to 0.5 inches thick. Consistency is key here.
3. Salt and pepper each piece.
4. Coat chicken in a little bit a flour, a generous amount of eggs, and a very
   generous amount of Penko bread crumbs.
   - I like to let curry do the seasoning, but feel free to add more seasoning
     to Penko bread crumbs.
5. Fry each piece of meat in vegetable oil, about 3.25 minutes per side.

### Final
1. Serve together in bowl.
