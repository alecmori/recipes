Makes 12

Ingredients:

100ml milk (can be plant based)

100ml oil (I usually use olive)

2 eggs

3/4 glass liquid honey - REAL honey

1 teaspoon vanilla essence

1.5 glass self-raising flour

3/4 glass sugar

1/2 teaspoon cinnamon

pinch of salt

Bonus info for ingredients:

You could easily get away with 1/2 glass sugar because you have honey adding a LOT of sweetness, and if you add more salt it will amplify the flavours more. I haven't experimented with this salt part yet.

You can add a pinch of black pepper to add a bit of kick. Works really well with the cinnamon, especially at Christmas time.

Recipe:

Preheat the oven (with fan) at 180 degrees Celsius.

2. Whisk the milk, oil, eggs, honey and vanilla essence until evenly combined.

3. In a separate bowl, which will be your main mixing bowl, mix the flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon and optional black pepper until evenly combined. I do this with just a spoon.

4. Pour the pre-mixed wet ingredients into the dry ingredients little by little and stir until evenly combined, making sure that there are no lumps. Again, I do this with just a spoon, but you can do it with an electric mixer.

5. The mix will be very runny and wet. Prepare a muffin baking tray and line the slots - I use reusable silicon cases if eating them at home, or paper cases if they're leaving the house and I want them to look all fancy. Use a tablespoon to transfer the mixture into the cases. It's worth using two spoons to avoid leakage as you do. Each case will hold about 2.5 spoonfuls of the mix, but I never assume this. I transfer just one spoonful in every case, then another spoonful, then I eyeball which ones seem to have the least mix and I add more there and I keep them as even as I can. Don't be afraid of overfilling, but obviously don't let it leak down the sides. I often wind up with a little extra mix for another muffin or two, you can bake this once the first batch is done.

6. It's a relatively slow bake. Expect it to take 30-45 minutes, but I set my timer at 20mins and I then check roughly every 5. Bake until they grow nice and round, golden with maybe just a hint of browning, and when you stick a toothpick in it comes out dry. It might feel kinda sticky when you pull it out because that's what they're like, sticky and moist - because of the honey. Just make sure the stick doesn't come out caked in raw mix.

7. Once you're satisfied that they're done switch off the oven and open the door, but leave the muffins in so they brown a little more - don't worry, it will never be too much. If you leave the door closed they will get soggy - no bueno.

8. Once cooled they're ready and delicious to eat. However, if you want to amplify them just a touch you can add a bit of chocolate sauce. What I do is get just any old dark chocolate - it MUST be dark, anything else is blasphemy (dark balances well with the sweetness of the honey, milk chocolate will be sugar overload) - and I melt it and then haphazardly splash it over the muffins with no rhyme or reason using a spoon or brush. I don't paint them, they never have an even coating of chocolate, just thin lines. That way the bitterness is not overwhelming and it compliments the sweetness of the muffin beautifully.
