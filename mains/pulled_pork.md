## Makes

One slow cooker full of pulled pork, roughly 16 burgers

## Ingredients

- 1 cup of bbq sauce
- 0.5 cups of chicken broth
- 0.25 cups of apple cider vinegar
- 1 teaspoon liquid smoke
- 6 cloves garlic

- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- 2 teaspoons chili powder
- 2 teaspoons black pepper
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon mustard powder
- 0.5 teaspoon cayenne powder

## Utilities

- Slow cooker
- Big mixing bowl

## Recipe

1. Mince garlic. Put it in slow cooker.
2. Whisk together bbq sauce, chicken broth, vinegar, and liquid smoke in slow
   cooker.
3. Mix all spice in big mixing bowl. Place pork shoulder in the mixing bowl.
   Coat pork shoulder in mixing, making extra effort to get spice mix
   everywhere on the shoulder.
4. Move pork shoulder into slow cooker and pour whatever little remaining spice
   onto shoulder.
5. Turn slow cooker on low and cook for 12 hours.
   - I normally start this the night before. When I wake up, I open the slow
     cooker, remove the bone, and shred the pork.

## Notes

Want to start cooking this at least a day before

Served on toasted brioche buns, or cornbread, or on macaroni and cheese. Goes well with
brussel sprouts.
