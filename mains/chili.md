[Original Recipe](https://damndelicious.net/2019/04/03/easy-slow-cooker-chili/)

## Makes

One slow cooker full of chili, maybe 12-16 bowls?

## Ingredients

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 lbs ground meat
- 6 cloves garlic
- 1 medium sweet onion
- 2 jalape√±o peppers
- 1 red pepper
- 1 cup of chicken stock
- 1 (16-ounce) can red kidney beans
- 1 (16-ounce) can black beans
- 1 (16-ounce) can white beans
- 1 (15-ounce) can crushed tomatoes (seasoned)
- 1 (14.5-ounce) can petite diced tomatoes (seasoned)
- 5 tablespoons chili powder
- 4 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 6 teaspoons dried oregano
- 5 teaspoons ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons berbere
- 1 teaspoon hot sauce
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

### Optional

- 2 tablespoons of harissa

## Utilities

- Slow cooker
- Frying pan
- Sieve

## Recipe

1. Mince garlic, peppers, and onion. Put peppers in slow cooker.
2. Rinse and drain all beans. Put beans in slow cooker.
3. Fry the onions, garlic, and meat on medium-heat until meat is browned. Include all berbere,
   2 teaspoons oregano, 0.5 tablespoons chili powder, 2 teaspoons cumin.
   - Rubbing spices into meat beforehand help with even coating.
   - Onions and meat go in together - garlic can go when meat has begun to
     brown.
4. Drain meat mixture in sieve, but do not rinse. Then, move meat to slow
   cooker.
5. Add all seasoning to slow cooker.
6. Add chicken stock to slow cooker.
7. Add cans of tomatoes to slow cooker.
8. Cook for 8 hours on low heat.
   - You'll want to stir it at least once; I find doing it at the four hour
     mark and six hour mark the best.

## Notes

This recipe also goes well with macaroni and cheese, cornbread, garlic bread,
or sour cream and tortilla chips.
